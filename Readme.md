# Examples for TDD

## Transaction filter
Try during demo:
   * For ShareTransactionsSumReporter, handle edge case when transaction made on 1/04/2018
   * For ShareTransactionsSumReporter, handle business case to include transactions with 100 shares, 
   this should break the functionality in ShareTransactionsSomeOtherReporter
   * snippets.txt has the logic snippet for shareTransactionFilter handling the edge case 
   
## TDD exercise
   * Create a Triangle that exposes 2 methods: perimeter and isRightAngled. TrianglePreDone has a final reference implementation
   * CSV processor to see how to test when IO is involved with and without mock
